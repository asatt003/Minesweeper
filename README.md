# Minesweeper
My attempt at Minesweeper.

UPDATE 7:15 PM PST: Minesweeper BARELY works.
    1. User is able to play.
    2. Upon clicking a bomb, all positions are revealed.
    3. User is unable to flag potential bomb positions.
    4. User is able to reset the game upon clicking a bomb. 
    5. Positions are randomized upon game reset.
